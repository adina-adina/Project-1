My research question is: "Did historic shifts in women's suffrage in 1920 and in 1980 contribute to changes in the patterns of vote outcomes?"  After running chi square tests the conclusion is "no."  Please refer to the texts and graphs in the Jupyter Notebook file for further details and analysis.

ChatGPT helped with me with some of the coding, although all of the concepts and logic are my own.
